The egress requirements for residential buildings, including stair design and emergency exits, are detailed in the California Residential Code 2022. Here are the key points:

### Means of Egress
1. **General Requirements**:
   - Dwellings must have a continuous and unobstructed path of vertical and horizontal egress travel from all portions of the dwelling to the required egress door without requiring travel through a garage.
   - The required egress door must open directly into a public way or to a yard or court that opens to a public way【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

2. **Egress Door**:
   - Each dwelling unit must have at least one egress door.
   - The egress door must be side-hinged and provide a clear width of at least 32 inches and a clear height of at least 78 inches.
   - Egress doors must be readily openable from inside the dwelling without the use of a key or special knowledge【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

3. **Floors and Landings at Exterior Doors**:
   - There must be a landing or floor on each side of each exterior door.
   - The width of each landing must be at least the width of the door served, and the dimension in the direction of travel must be at least 36 inches.
   - The slope at exterior landings must not exceed 2 percent【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

4. **Vertical Egress**:
   - Egress from habitable levels, including attics and basements, must be provided by one or more ramps or stairways.
   - For levels more than one story above or below an egress door, the maximum travel distance to a stairway or ramp must not exceed 50 feet【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### Emergency Escape and Rescue Openings
1. **General Requirements**:
   - Basements, habitable attics, and every sleeping room must have at least one operable emergency escape and rescue opening.
   - These openings must open directly into a public way or to a yard or court that opens to a public way【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

2. **Exceptions**:
   - Basements with a ceiling height of less than 80 inches are not required to have emergency escape and rescue openings.
   - Basements or sleeping rooms with an exit door that opens directly into a public way or to a yard, court, or exterior egress balcony that opens to a public way are exempt.
   - Basements without habitable spaces and having not more than 200 square feet in floor area are also exempt【4:2†source】【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

3. **Operational Constraints**:
   - Emergency escape and rescue openings must be free of obstructions and operational from the inside without the use of keys, tools, or special knowledge.
   - Window opening control devices and fall prevention devices complying with ASTM F2090 are permitted【4:3†source】【4:4†source】.

### Stair Design
1. **General Requirements**:
   - Stairways must be constructed in accordance with Section R311.7 of the California Residential Code.
   - Specific dimensions and requirements for risers, treads, handrails, and headroom must be followed to ensure safety and accessibility【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

These requirements ensure that residential buildings provide safe and accessible means of egress in case of emergencies, complying with the California Residential Code 2022.
